The signatures for models are defined in source/proj1_model_creation.als

The abstract sig are: 

ValidateObj, which represents the object need to be validated when user input a new entry to the board. It is extended by Row, Column, and Square9 which have some of the same properties.

Notification, which notifies the user there is either an error or InvalideMove when user make a new move. Errors and InvalideMove have the same property of notifing the user. 

ValidValue, which defines a set of values which are validate for a ValidateObj for current status of the object. Two abstract signatures: ValidObjValue and ValidCellValue extends it. 

ValidObjValue, which indicates the set of valid value for current ValidObj, in which has 9 cells. It is extended by three signatures: ValidColumnVal, ValidRowVal, and ValidSquareVal. They have the common property of containing 9 cells, and each cell should have a different value.
